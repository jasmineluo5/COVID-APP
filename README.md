# COVID-APP
This app is an ios app designed to help people in underserved communities cope with COVID-19 and bring the convenience of accessing healthcare in those communities.

## Inspiration
People in underserved communities usually lack access to immediate information, such as information about COVID vaccines. Furthermore, they lack resources for healthcare, usually caused by the lack of transportations and language barrier. Our app was inspired by this fact and we aim to help them overcome the challenges to access information and resources and improve the healthcare system within the underserved communities.

## What it does
- With our app, you can locate nearby healthcare professional with ease and look up healthcare with certain specialty. This app is integrated with the IQVIA's HealthCare Locator SDK, which has one of the most extensive and accurate healthcare information worldwide, and is updated daily.
- Out app supports mutliple languages for looking up healthcare professionals function
- With a touch of button, you can call an uber to your choose healthcare professional (such as a clinic, or a hospital). (Downloading the Uber app and Logging into an Uber account is required)
- You can join a telemedicine session through Zoom without having to logging in, or starting an instant meeting after logging onto Zoom


## How we built it
We built it with Swift in Xcode, designed the front end in Storyboard. This app is integrated with the IQVIA's HealthCare Locator SDK, Uber Api, and Zoom SDK.

## Challenges we ran into
This app is our first experience with ios development since no one on our team had any previous knowledge in ios development or even Swift. The biggest challenge was figuring out how to build an ios app, and we were proud of the progress we have made within such short period of time. 
Another challenge that we had is figuring out how to retrieve information from the GraphQL of the healthcare SDK endpoints to our app. So far, the attempts were unsuccessful and we will keep communicating with the SDK development team and figure out a solution.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were proud that we were able to pick up the language Swift within a short period of time and build an app that has integrated multiple SDKs and enabled several useful functionalities. We were also proud of how well we function as a team because the communication within the team was always efficient.

## What we learned
- Building an ios app from scratch
- Front-end and UI design in Storyboard
- Searching for SDKs for desired functionalities and integrating various SDKs into a single app
- Communicating effectively as a team


## What's next for Covid 
- A system to schedule telemedicine sessions with hospitals
- Support multiple languages, so far the app only supports English and French
- Implement the Android version
- fully functioning Uber feature
