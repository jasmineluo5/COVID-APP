# MedCONNECT
This iOS application helps connect those in underserved communities to nearby healthcare providers by providing a convenient location for both telecommunication and ride-sharing.

## Inspiration
People in underserved communities sometimes lack access to immediate information, such as information about COVID vaccines. Furthermore, they may lack the resources for proper healthcare that can be in part caused by a lack of transportation and language barriers. Our app was inspired by this need and we aim to help answer these challenges to better facilitate care for those in need.

## What it does
- With our app, you can locate nearby healthcare organiziations and identify specific healthcare proivders to cater to specific needs. More specifically, this app is integrated with IQVIA's HealthCare Locator SDK, which has one of the most extensive and accurate healthcare information worldwide, to provide the most comprehensive care.
- Our app supports mutliple languages for looking up healthcare professionals function.
- In addition, once a healthcare provider has been selected, our app has integrated the Uber API to allow users to facilitate a ride to your choose healthcare professional. (Downloading the Uber app and Logging into an Uber account is required)
- You can join a telemedicine session through Zoom without having to logging in, or starting an instant meeting after logging onto Zoom.

## How we built it
We built it with Swift in Xcode and designed the UI with Storyboard. Additionally, this app is integrated with the IQVIA's HealthCare Locator SDK, Uber Api, and Zoom SDK.

## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest struggle was that we began developement of this application with no previous iOS experience. As one can expect, this proved to be quite the sturggle as we figured out the best method to build an application. Thus, while our journey has been marked by struggle, we are proud of the progress we have made within such short period of time. 
Another challenge that we faced was figuring out how to retrieve information from the GraphQL of the healthcare SDK endpoints to our app. So far, we have been unsuccessful with our attempts, but we will continue to communicate with the SDK development team to figure out a solution.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to pick up the Swift language within a short period of time and build an app that has integrated multiple SDKs and enabled several useful functionalities. We were also proud of how well we functioned as a team and its consistent communication.

## What we learned
- Building an iOS app from scratch
- Front-end and UI design in Storyboard
- Searching for SDKs for desired functionalities and integrating various SDKs into a single app
- Communicating effectively as a team


## What's next for MedCONNECT 
- A system to schedule telemedicine sessions with hospitals
- Support more languages, so far the app only supports English and French
- Implement the Android version
- Fully functioning Uber feature
